# Cavity-Flow
MATLAB-based cavity flow analysis project, completed in Februrary 2023.

This project involves the numerical analysis of a cavity flow using MATLAB, focusing on both flow field and heat transfer behavior. The solution uses the vorticity-stream function formulation to simplify the governing equations.

Overview
  Key aspects of the project:

    * Normalization of the governing equations.
    * Vorticity-Stream Function formulation applied to simplify the Navier-Stokes equations.
    * Solved using the finite difference method.
    * Analysis of both isothermal and temperature-variant cases.
    * Mesh grid independence study to ensure result accuracy.
    * Results plotted for different Grashof numbers.

Features:
    * Solves flow field and heat transfer in a 2D cavity.
    * Compares results for isothermal and temperature-variant cases.
    * Analyzes mesh independence and visualizes the effects of varying Grashof numbers.
    
Contents:
    * Code/: MATLAB .m files for the numerical solution.
    * Results/: Plots showing flow fields and temperature distribution for different Grashof numbers.
    
How to Run
Download the MATLAB code files from the Code/ folder.
Run the main script (cavity_flow_analysis.m) for isothermal and temperature-variant cases.
Mesh grid independence and results for different Grashof numbers will be plotted and saved in the Results/ folder.
